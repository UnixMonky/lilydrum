 * show 8th and 16th beats in beaming, currently only 8ths:  d32[[ g] d[ g]] d32[[ g] d[ g]]
 * Macro for tutti's (unisons)
 * Macro for "Part 2 of $n"
 * If 8/16/32/..th notes come before a flam, they have a flag instead of a beam (fixable by explicit beaming, but rather have a good autobeaming)
 * A tuplet beginning with a flam has a strange tuplet beam (slanted) (fixable by putting the flam outside of the tuplet .. )
 * It's customary to have 4 bars per line for portrait and 8 for landscape...
