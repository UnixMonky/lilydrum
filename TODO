TODO
 * flam function : detect whether left flam or right flam. This depends on the note, whether it is right or left respectively
 * show 8th and 16th beats in beaming, currently only 8ths
 * include EUSPBA flourishing symbols, maybe a sprite file ?!?
	* spanners (traditional and regimental spanners)
	* symbols
 * Very special beats (backsticking, crosssticking and the like..)
 * Macros for tutti's (unisons), "Part 2 of $n",
