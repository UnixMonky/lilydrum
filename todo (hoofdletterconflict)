 * show 8th and 16th beats in beaming, currently only 8ths
 * Macro for tutti's (unisons)
 * Macro for "Part 2 of $n"
 * If 8/16/32/..th notes come before a flam, they have a flag instead of a beam (fixable by explicit beaming, but rather have a good autobeaming)
 * A tuplet beginning with a flam has a strange tuplet beam (slanted)
 * It's customary to have 4 bars per line for portrait and 8 for landscape...
